#Case Study 2
Located in the Examples/CaseStudy2
Platform trial with 1 ISA.
1 interim analysis at when 30 patients have 24 weeks of follow-up
Final Analysis (FA) when all patients have the outcome observed.
30 patients on control 60 patients on treatment
Primary outcome is repeated measure evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks after treatment
