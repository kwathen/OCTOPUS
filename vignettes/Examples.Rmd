# Examples
Examples are included in the installation folder as case studies, CaseStudy2 and CaseStudy3 with corresponding R Studio project files CaseStudy2.Rpoj and CaseStudy3.Rpoj, respectively.    Below is a brief description of each case study.  

## Case Study 1
One of the first tasks that is typically conducted by a team is the comparison of patient recruitment in a platform trial with two ISAs versus two sequential POC studies.  This case study utilized the R Shiny App in this package to compare the recruitment under a given set of assumptions regarding patient recruitment rates, number of sites and time delay for platform trial versus consecutive POC studies.  The focus is on the operational comparisons rather than statistical comparisons.

## Case Study 2
Platform trial with 1 ISA.
1 interim analysis at when 30 patients have 24 weeks of follow-up
Final Analysis (FA) when all patients have the outcome observed.
30 patients on control 60 patients on treatment
Primary outcome is repeated measure evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks after treatment
Analyze difference from baseline at week 24 compared to control
Minimum Acceptable Value MAV = 0.5 difference between control and treatment
This is the minimum difference between treatment and control
( m24 - m0 )Cont â€“ (m24 - m0 )Trt

## Case Study 3
Located in the Examples/CaseStudy3
Platform trial with 1 ISA.
No  interim analysis
Final Analysis (FA) when all patients have the outcome observed.
30 patients on control 60 patients on treatment
Assume same design as Case Study 2
No need to modify the TrialDesign.R file
Assume that patients either respond (R) or they are non-responder NR
If a patient is a responder (R) their outcomes are generated from mean vector 2
If a patient is a non-responder (NR) their outcomes are generated from mean vector 1
Utilize SimPatientOutcomes.MVNWithCovariate outcome type
Historical data suggests that 2% of patients on control will respond.
Treatment should increase the % of responders.
