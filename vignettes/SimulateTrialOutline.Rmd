## OCTOPUS - RunSimulation
This document is intended to give an outline of the steps involved in running a simulation to help users determine where and what would need to be modified.  

* RunSimulaiton (located in RunSimulation.R) 
 In this function loops are created to loop over all the designs and simulation scenarios for each design.  
 Within the loop the SimulateScenario function is called.

    + SimulateScenario (located in SimulateScenario.R )  In this function a scenario is simulated by simulate multiple replications of a single trial.  A call to SimulateSingleTrial is called in a loop

       + SimulateSingleTrial (located in SimulateSingleTrial.R ) This function will simulate one virtual trial for a given scenario.   The function begins by simulating patient data by callingâ€¦ 

          + ... Need to fill in detail
 
          + If it is time to run an analysis 
     
              + RunTrialAnalysis - (located in RunTrialAnalysis.R) - This generic function has a default implementation that creates a dataset for the entire platform, loops over each ISA and calls RunISAAnalysis with only the data relevant to the ISA analysis.  
                + CreateDataSetForAnalsis is called (located in CreateDataSetForAnalysis.R) This function has a default implementation that will create a dataset for the entire platform
                   + ProcessData is called - This function takes the simulated data and processes it, eg gets it ready for analysis.  For example, if you simulate a repeated measure over time and want to analyze change from baseline the ProcessData function can compute the change from baseline so that the analysis function does not need to pre-process the data.  
              
                + RunISAAnalysis - Located in RunISAAnalysis.R - This generic function has a default implementation that will loop over the Analysis list (eg multiple outcomes) and call RunAnalysis for each Analysis
