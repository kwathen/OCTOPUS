## Introduction
This project is designed to help clinical trial designers simulate a platform trial.   This project is intended for simulation purposes.  A fairly large R code base has been developed but as on now only a few files are ready to be pushed to the public GitHub repo.  As more become ready they will be pushed to this repository. 

This package is designed to help simulate platform trials but due to the fact it is being used to simulate trials that are not platform trials we are considering the following new names
1.  Master Adaptive Design Simulator or MADs
2.  Master Adaptive Protocol Simulator or MAPs

Please considerer sending suggestions for other names.
