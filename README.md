## Introduction
This project is designed to help clinical trial designers simulate a platform trial.   This project is intended for simulation purposes.  A fairly large R code base has been developed but as on now only a few files are ready to be pushed to the public GitHub repo.  As more become ready they will be pushed to this repository. 


The first public release version of this package is under development and will be released here when it is complete.  The tar.gz files in this repository are included as testing versions for beta testers as new updates are added. 

Please follow this project to be notified of updates.
