Requirements:
    OCTOPUS V 1.3.0.4
    If you are on a Grid the OCTOPUS package could be installed in a subdirectory, such as RLibrary if needed and then just reference the
    correct package.  The same approach could be taken if you are not running on a grid.
    
    Example:
    Install
    install.packages("OCTOPUS_1.3.0.4.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source", lib="RLibrary")

    Reference
    library( "OCTOPUS", lib.loc = "RLibrary" )

   


Description
This example is to simulate a platform trial with 3 ISAs. 
The primary outcome is a binary outcome observed 6 months after the patient is treated.
The analysis that will be done is a Bayesian Beta-Binomial.

Since a binary outcome and the Beta-Binomial model are not part of the core OCTOPUS package new functions need to be develped to
simulate the patient outcomes and run the Beta-Binomial analysis.

R Code

Begin with the BuildMe.R file.    This file loads the OCTOPUS package and sources the design file as well as the new files 
for the binary outcome and the new analysis. 

The file TrialDesign.R contains the function necessary to setup the design object.
The file SimulationDesign.R contains the functions necessary to setup the simulation design.
