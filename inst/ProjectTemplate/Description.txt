Requirements:
    OCTOPUS V 1.3.0.4
    If you are on a Grid the OCTOPUS package could be installed in a subdirectory, such as RLibrary if needed and then just reference the
    correct package.  The same approach could be taken if you are not running on a grid.

    Example:
    Install
    install.packages("OCTOPUS_1.3.0.4.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source", lib="RLibrary")

    Reference
    library( "OCTOPUS", lib.loc = "RLibrary" )
