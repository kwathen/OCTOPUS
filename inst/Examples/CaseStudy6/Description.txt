Requirements:
    PlatformTrialSimulator package version 1.2.1.1
    Install the PTS package on grid with
    For Unix systems you may install similar to R CMD INSTALL -l $HOME/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/3.5 PlatformTrialSimulator_1.2.1.1.tar.gz




Description
Case study 4 builds on case study 3 and adds a second ISA
Platform trial with 2 ISAs.
2nd ISA enters the platform between month 3 and 6.
2nd ISA will have two doses and control (change from Case study 4)
No  interim analysis
Final Analysis (FA) when all patients have the outcome observed.
30 patients on control 60 patients on treatment
Assume same design as Case Study 2
No need to modify the TrialDesign.R file
Assume that patients either respond (R) or they are non-responder NR
If a patient is a responder (R) their outcomes are generated from mean vector 2
If a patient is a non-responder (NR) their outcomes are generated from mean vector 1
Utilize SimPatientOutcomes.MVNWithCovariate outcome type
Historical data suggests that 2% of patients on control will respond.
Treatment should increase the % of responders.

R Code
Begin with the BuildMe.R file.    This file loads the PlatformTrialSimulator package and sources the design file.
The file TrialDesign.R contains the function necessary to setup the design object.
The file SimulationDesign.R contains the functions necessary to setup the simulation design.
In the SimulationDesign.R there is a change to add the outcomes for the 2nd dose in ISA 2.
