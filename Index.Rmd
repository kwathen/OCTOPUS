## Introduction
This project is designed to help clinical trial designers simulate a platform trial.   This project is intended for simulation purposes only.  For the purposes of this project, a platform trial is a clinical trial designed to accommodate multiple treatments or interventions added to the trial either at the beginning of the trial or any time thereafter.   Each intervention is added through an Intervention Specific Appendix (ISA).  Each ISA typically randomizes between placebo or control and one or more intervention doses (or combinations).  If trials for multiple interventions in the same disease area are considered, then a platform trial provides a unified framework for designing and running a single, multiple ISA, platform trial.  Potential benefits of a platform trial are shorter, more efficient trials due to a single framework for multiple interventions and borrowing of placebo or control patients across ISAs, thus reducing the overall number of patients treated with placebo/control.  

This package is under development. It is functional and has already been used to simulate several trials.  As case studies are created, they will be added to the Examples directory of the package to help users create the necessary structures.  The tar.gz files in this repository are included as testing versions for beta testers while as new updates and structure are added.

## Installation 
Currently this package is not available on CRAN but may be installed directly from 1) GitHub or 2) a tar.gz files located in GitHub.  The most recent version is [Version 1.3.0.3](https://github.com/kwathen/OCTOPUS/blob/master/MiscFiles/OCTOPUS1.3.0.3.tar.gz).   

### Installation Option 1 - From GitHub
Utilizing the [remotes package](https://remotes.r-lib.org/)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  remotes::install_github( "kwathen/OCTOPUS", "Version1.3.0.3" )
```

### Installation Option 2 - Using a tar.gz File

Download the tar.gz file [Version 1.3.0.3](https://github.com/kwathen/OCTOPUS/blob/master/MiscFiles/OCTOPUS1.3.0.3.tar.gz).
In R with the tar.gz file in your  current working directory the following command will install the package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("OCTOPUS_1.3.0.3.tar.gz", repos=NULL)
````

## Usage 
In the instillation folder there is an Examples directory that contains full examples.
